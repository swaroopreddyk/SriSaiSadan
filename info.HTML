Once when he was traveling with the saddle on his back, he met young saibaba. After enquiring from him, Saibaba asked Chand Patil to search in the nala (pond) nearby. To the surprise of Chand Patil, he found his lost mare. After accepting the request of Chand Patil, this young fakir stayed in Dhoop for sometime and returned to Shirdi when he was around twenty along with the marriage party of Chand Patil. The marriage party took their shelter in the fields of Khandoba temple and Bhagat Mhalasapati addressed the young fakir as ?Aao Sai? (Welcome Sai). From that day onwards, people started calling him as Sai.</p>

                        <p>Baba started to live in a deserted masjid, which had two rooms. Baba called this as ?Dwarakamai? and always used to utter ?Allah Malik?. Baba used to sit in the masjid facing south and in front of him he kept dhuni burning. He did this throughout his stay in Shirdi, even today that is still burning. He was very fond of lights. He used to light lamps in the masjid and kept them burning through out the night. During his stay in Shirdi he maintained Lendi Garden. Once when he went to Rahata, he brought with him small plants of Jui, Jai and MerryGold and planted them in the garden. All the years he cleaned and watered the palnts using the unbaked earthen pots supplied by Vaman Tatya daily. Later the Samadhi Mandir was constructed in this site only by Bapusaheb Buti..</p>

He used to know the past, present and future of the devotees. Sai gave them some suggestions and used to suggest reading of religious scriptures like Vishnu Sahasranaam, Guru Charitra, Ramakhayan, Ramavijaya and so on. In order to benefit Madhavarao Deshpande alias Shama, Sai forcibly made him study Vishnu Sahasranaam and said to Shama, ?when I was in deep trouble, I hugged this book and you do not know the benefit this book did to me?. Baba emphasized the importance of this book to his devotees..</p>

Later people started coming to Shirdi to seek his blessings and advice to fulfill their wishes. During his early days at Shirdi, Baba used to cook food and distribute the same to the devotees. He maintained 2 handis (pots) for cooking.</p>

He always suggested applying the udi to his devotees as a remedy to the problems they faced and used to tell them that ?ALLAH ACCHA KAREGA? (God will do Good). He also maintained perfect harmony between Hindus and Muslims. He advocated both the practices simultaneously. He celebrated Hindu festivals and Muslim festivals in unison. Sriramanavami festival at Shirdi is one best example to demonstrate this fact. Sandal procession in the name of Muslim saints is also performed on the same day.</p>

Sai said to his devotees to put their burdens on him and assured he will bear them for them. But to do this, he said every devotee has to be earnest in their devotion and give two paisa dakshina, ?FAITH (Shraddha)? and ?PATIENCE (Saburi)?.</p>
